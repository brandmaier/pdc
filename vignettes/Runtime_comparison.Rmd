```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```

```{r setup}
library(pdc)
library(tictoc)
```

The computation of codebooks in `pdc` up to embedding dimension 7 is implemented in C code for faster execution. Here is a comparison of the gain in speed by switching from the R implementation using `sort` to the C implementation based on nested `Ã¬f` blocks. First, the fast computation in C:

```{r}
N <- 50000
x <- rnorm(N)
tic()
codebook <- pdc::codebook(x, m=7, use.fast = TRUE)
toc()
```

Then, the naive implementation in R:

```{r}
tic()
codebook <- pdc::codebook(x, m=7, use.fast = FALSE)
toc()
```
